## Linting
```bash
$ yarn pretest
```

## Test It

```bash
$ yarn test
```

## Environments
- `test` - runs locally or on Heroku CI when executing `yarn test`
- `development` - runs locally when executing `yarn dev`, url: http://localhost:3000
- `staging` - runs in `staging` phase of Heroku Pipeline when pull requests are merged to `master` branch, when executing `yarn start`, url: https://staging.whatsmy.fit
- `production` - runs in `production` phase of Heroku Pipeline when `manually` promoted from staging, when executing `yarn start`, url: https://whatsmy.fit

## Security
- TLS is enabled for `staging` and `production` environments by enabling TLS in Heroku. In addition ExpressJS server 
is configured to redirect all requests from HTTP to HTTPS, see [sslRedirect.ts](server/common/sslRedirect.ts), for these two environments
